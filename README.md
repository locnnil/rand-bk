# Rand Bk

This tool is designed to launch your terminal emulator with a random background color, chosen from a predefined set of colors.
It is particularly useful for those who enjoy a bit of variety in their terminal aesthetics.

## Motivation

Often you're working on the terminal and then you open multiple tabs or windows, and they all look the same.
This can make it hard to quickly identify which terminal window you're working no what.
By using a random background color, you can easily distinguish between different terminal instances.
